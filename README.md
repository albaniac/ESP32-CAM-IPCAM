# ESP32-CAM-IPCAM

no SD-card enabled.

i dont know why the combination does not work

SD.begin conflicts with http webserver

The folder PHP is sample code to use on a dedicated php webserver (eg. raspberrypi)
this code wil capture a image from ESP32-CAM and copies the image to the raspberrypi.

(edit the php code to your IP-addresses )
